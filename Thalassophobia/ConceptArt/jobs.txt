(these are to remind hub what the hell he was thinking when making these, ignore any cringe experienced this is just a stream of conciousness)

clowns: jobs with "downsides"

!JESTER: troll
Theme: Disguise, Screwery, Pranks.
Appeal: Fuck with crew
Being a jester is not helpful to the group, but ideally is so fun to be on its own that people will pick it regardless. The pranks that jesters pull are nonlethal to an extent that having a clown won't be innately harmful to achieving the mission. This applies to the other clown variants as well (in that they have the option to screw over other people), but to a lesser extent.
Gameplay-wise, they are trolls and trap-setters. They can "troll" both humans and monsters. They are also comic relief obviously. They have a near-unlimited amount of items they can make. They can choose to start doing things with "real damage" to individuals (like inflicting vampirism) but the process (crafting tree) should be excessively lengthy, unorthadox, take up most of their inventory, and be a hindrance.
--COSTUMES:
husk (wip)
grim reaper
angel
suit and tie
punk
robocop/robot
police officer
detective
coral

rankings use safe euclid keter (S/E/K) for balancing purposes. safe is for harmless shenanigans, euclid is for considerable annoyances, keter is for lethality/potentially permenant afflictions/losses

E]-PINATAS: Cralwer, Mudraptor, Hammerhead, Moloch party

!HONKCHILD: summoner
Theme: Lovecraft, Treehugger, Friend-To-Nasty-Animals, Nightmare Fuel, Satanism, Gamzeesque.
Appeal: Be creepy and weird, have gross pets
Bootleg xenobios that instead deal with supernatural stuff. This means things like witchdoctor-tier medicines (easier to make but less effective) and summonings, which make them stand out since they can summon good things. 
Gameplay-wise, they are summoners and minor healers (to boost themselves in the event of crew conflict). Their summons might go wrong or get out of control.

!MIME: narc
Theme: Individaulism, Sacrifice, Greed(?), Paranoia, SS13 Mime Superiority Complex
Appeal: Get superpowers enough to support yourself and only yourself
This role is an experiment that intentionally moves away from the collaborative nature of baro. A mime's lack of ability to communicate inherently prevents communication, and resultingly, collaboration. Because you cannot talk, suspicion will naturally mount against you in the event of suspicious activity onboard. You will also be unable to cry for help, or draw from the benefits that a team normally would give you. As a result, the mime has superpowers that partially make up for this lack of a team, and grant them individualism.
Gameplay-wise, mimes are withdrawn narcissists, will draw in players who are narcissists, and will make everyone who plays them narcissistic. Zero contribution to the team, but they can hold their own.

scientists: smart weaklings

!XENOBIOLOGIST: misc
Theme: Has-Science-Gone-Too-Far, Alien Tech, Cloning, Frankenstein, Sci-Fi of the Flesh, Botany, Thalamus Studies, Creature loot galore, Botany
Appeal: Make weird and bizzare unpredictable items, harvest ruins to their fullest
Ideally with the xenobio role alien ruins and thalamus wrecks serve more purpose. power cells can be processed into weird alien technology that is super unorthadox but ultimately helps the crew in the long run. maybe make some more


!TECHROMANCER: upgrade
Theme: Rise of the machines, gradual progression of standard items, quality of life improvements, advanced weaponry/armor, drones
