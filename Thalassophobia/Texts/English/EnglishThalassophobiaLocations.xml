	<thalcampaign_newbrief>You are new arrivals on Europa. You just got your Coalition Citizen ID a few minutes ago after waiting at a shuttle arrival checkpoint. The world of Barotrauma is new and mysterious, and you want to experience it through new eyes.
	
	You start with no perks, benefits, or reputation bonuses, but conversely you are on neutral standing with all of the factions. As the campaign progresses, you will be presented with the opportunity to join and leave factions as you please like any other background preset. 
	
	Choose this route to start with a clean slate, like in Vanilla Barotrauma.
	</thalcampaign_newbrief>
	
	<thalcampaign_corporatebrief>Corporate Agents are black operations specialists working for the Coalition Anti Terrorist Police (CATPOL). Your job consists of hunting down seperatist insurgents and putting an end to the insurgency by any means necessary. It's a dirty job, and almost all CATPOL agents are "bad cops" in one way or another.
	
	You have special access to Black Sites that house secret government projects, as well as some of the newest high-grade gear on Europa. You are in many ways above the law, but don't get the wrong idea: You are not "free". If you stray too far from Coalition interests, the chain of command from on high will activate your implanted killswitch.
	
	Choose this route for an experience as a potentially corrupt powertripping law enforcer.
	</thalcampaign_corporatebrief>
	
	<thalcampaign_circusbrief>As humanity extends their stay on Europa, more and more ships mysteriously become registered as "travelling circuses". These crews consist of Europans loyal to the ideas (or lack of ideas) of the Children of the Honkmother. Loyal to nobody except chaos itself, clown ships have been sighted going from outpost to outpost, harassing their denizens with annoying clown antics.
	
	Clown crews will have access to ridiculous dialogue options that may result in almost spontaneous results, with a large emphasis placed on randomness. Clown insurgents at outposts will supply clown crews with lots of goods to keep the chaos going.
	
	Choose this route for a wild ride of screwing around and watching the world burn.
